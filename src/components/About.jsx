                        I am a front end developer always looking to expand my skills. I am proficient in HTML, CSS and Javascript including frameworks
                        and libraries such as Jquery, React and Bootstrap. I prefer to code with React when developing my projects, not just because of it's popularity,
                        but also because I believe it offers the best potential for creativity on the Front-End while being able to manage and mantain state through on its own
                        or through Redux.
                        I also have skills in UI/UX design that would benefit any position I fill, being competent with Figma, graphic design with Gimp
                        and am always looking to grow and improve my skillset. I am also comfortable with popular industry tools like NPM, Git, SQL, BASH etc.
                        I am also actively improving my skills with languages like Python and C# that I hope to display here in the future. I am also a polyglot,
                        having learned multiple languages over the years such as French, Japanese and Latin.
